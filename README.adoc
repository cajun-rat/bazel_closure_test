# Hello World for Bazel rules_closure

This project demonstrates using bazel and the Google Closure Compiler rules to build a hello world web app.

The Javascript is compressed and minified using the Advanced Compilation mode

The CSS is minified, and the class names are renamed to shorten them

Soy templates are used to render the (single page) app.

In development mode, the local site is served up using php in 'serve the local directory' mode. It can be run with:

    bazel run //:run-httpd

The unit tests can be run with:

    bazel test //...

For production, a debian package is created containing the built artefacts.

    bazel build //:bazeltest
    dpkg-deb -c bazel-bin/bazeltest.deb
