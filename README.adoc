# Hello World

This project demonstrates using bazel and the Google Closure Compiler rules to build a hello world web app.

The Javascript is compressed and minified using the Advanced Compilation mode

The CSS is minified, and the class names are renamed to shorten them

Soy templates are used to render the (single page) app.

In development mode, the local site is served up using php in 'serve the local directory' mode. It can be run with_grep_options

    bazel run //:run-httpd

For production, a debian package is created containing the built artefacts.

    dpkg-deb -c bazel-bin/bazeltest.deb
